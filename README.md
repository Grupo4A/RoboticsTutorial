*Overview*

Here you can see the simulation and code implementation for 3 tasks performed at the EPSON Lab. The EPSON 6-axis robot is equipped with a vacuum nozzle for precise manipulations in the following tasks: 

*Task 1: Pick&Place*

This task is designed for the robot arm to efficiently pick circular and square tokens using its vacuum nozzle from a feeder located within the workspace of the robot. After picking each token, it places them into an alignment tray. Once aligned, the robot transfer the tokens to a tray with the corresponding shape. Upon completing the task for all tokens, the robot returns each of them to the feeder. 

*Task 2: Stacking*

This task is designed so that the robot operates on the located tokens from the tray. It systematically stacks circular and square tokens alternately on a designated surface, in this case the alignment tray.
